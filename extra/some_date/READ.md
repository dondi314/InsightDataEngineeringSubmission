# My Data

I included here my results on the largest internet traffic times on the NASA website.  The results really do show what times people use the website.  I included every increment of time in quarter hour increments on the hour, as well as the days of the week.  The data is then sorted from busiest to the least busiest.  At the top of the list are Thursdays and Wednesdays.  At the bottom portion of the are days more centered around weekends and really weird hours like 4:00 AM.

I also included my data from top ten users in terms of bandwidth.  Notice that here we get some different information from the top ten hosts information.  Nevertheless, the results do not differ by much.  I expected them to differ by a little more, but my guess is that it could be because the years are long ago.  I would expect this to be a useful statistic for some purposes.  For example, the may be very active users on a webpage who mostly post videos every couple of days, but other users who write messages constaly, but very rarely view or post videos.  Most likely they are using very little bandwidth in comparison to their video loving counterpart.
