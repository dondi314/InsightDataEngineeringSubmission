 # About these python files

    process_log.py is the main module

    some_useful_functions has a lot of stuff used by the other files
    
    features 1, 4, and 5 are all executed at once, and they depend on
    feature_1_and_4_and_5.py
    
    feature 3 depends heavily on feauture_3.py and feature_3_command.py
    
    feature 2 uses feature_2.py and newuser.py
    
    *NOTE:  If you do not care about feature 3, then you can hastag it out on
    the very last line of the process_log.py file.*
